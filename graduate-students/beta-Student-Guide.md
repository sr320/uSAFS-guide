```
The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS), established in 1919, offers courses and conducts
research on the conservation, management, and effective use of fish and invertebrate resources.
Education and research in the School includes studies of aquatic ecology; ichthyology; population
dynamics; management of free-ranging stocks; restoration ecology; aquaculture; seafood quality and
safety; and effects of human activities on freshwater and marine ecosystems.
```
## 1.1 DEGREE PROGRAMS

```
The SAFS program offers two graduate degrees; the M.S. and Ph.D., each require the preparation
of a thesis or dissertation, respectively.
```
```
The completion of a M.S. degree with thesis is normally required before application can be made to
enter the SAFS Ph.D. program. Students admitted at the pre-master’s level may apply to proceed
directly after completing requirements for the Master’s By-Pass.
```
## 1.2 GRADUATE PROGRAM COORDINATOR

```
The SAFS Graduate Program Coordinator (GPC), Professor Tim Essington, maintains a familiarity
with policies and procedures in the Graduate School and is responsible to the Graduate School for
matters of scholarship and for ensuring that a student's program of study is effectively supervised
and assessed (see Graduate School Memo
```

[http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo04.shtml](http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo04.shtml)

While the chairperson of the student’s supervisory committee generally provides academic advising,
the Graduate Program Coordinator is available for consultation on all matters that concern the

program.

## 1.3 GRADUATE PROGRAM ADVISER

The SAFS Graduate Program Adviser (GPA – staff adviser) is responsible for many of the
administrative functions of the program and is usually the first point of contact for inquiries. The

GPA (Amy Fox) maintains student records, assists with registration problems, provides all the
necessary forms leading to the completion of the degree, and provides advising on all matters

related to the degree programs. The GPA’s office is located in FSH Suite 116, Campus Mail Box
355020, (206) 616-5893 or amyfox@uw.edu or safs@uw.edu.

## 1.4 FACULTY ADVISER

A faculty adviser is assigned to each entering SAFS student at the time of admission (it is part of
the admission offer letter). The adviser is usually the chairperson of the student's supervisory

committee and supervises the student's research. While the faculty adviser provides advice related
to coursework and research projects, the GPC and GPA also continue to provide advice on all

related matters.

## 1.5 SAFS FACULTY

The SAFS faculty are designated as either “core” or “affiliate” faculty. Core faculty are those
involved in one or more of the following activities: administrative oversight of the program,

establishing program policy, admission decisions, working with SAFS graduate students (supervisory
committee chair or member), or serving in additional capacities (i.e., teaching and curriculum

development, serving as first year student adviser, supervisory committee membership, research
funding).

Affiliate faculty are defined as those previously endorsed by a vote of the SAFS core faculty to serve
on the SAFS faculty but who are not currently active in the program as defined above.

Voting on program affairs (program policy, admission decisions, new SAFS faculty, etc.) is
restricted to core faculty.

## 2.0 THE GRADUATE SCHOOL: POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

```
## 2.2 SCHOLARSHIP

```
A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or above is required to receive a degree from the Graduate School. A
graduate student's GPA is calculated entirely on the basis of numeric grades in 400 - and 500-level
courses. The grades of S, NS, CR, NC, and N are excluded, as are all grades in courses numbered
600, 601, 700, 750, and 800, and in courses at the 100, 200, and 300 levels.
```
```
Failure to maintain a 3.00 GPA, either cumulative or for a given quarter, constitutes low scholarship
and may lead to a change-in-status action by the Graduate School. Failure to maintain satisfactory
performance and progress toward a degree may also result in a change-in-status action by the
Graduate School.
```
```
See Graduate School Memorandum 16 for additional information:
http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo16.shtml
```
**2.3 UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE AND PROGRESS: CONTINUATION OR**

## STUDENTS IN THE GRADUATE SCHOOL


Review Process:

Review of students who maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA) is at the discretion of the
graduate program but is undertaken at least annually. Students whose cumulative or quarterly GPA

falls below a 3.0 must be reviewed quarterly and be provided with a written explanation of
performance expectations and a timetable for correction of deficiencies. Doctoral program students

are to be reviewed by their doctoral Supervisory Committee, or by a committee of graduate faculty
in the unit appointed or elected for this purpose in consultation with the student's Supervisory

Committee. Pre-doctoral or master's students are to be reviewed by supervisory committees, if such
committees have been appointed, or by the faculty advisor in SAFS. See Graduate School

Memorandum No. 13, Supervisory Committees for Graduate Students, for an explanation of the
role and responsibilities of supervisory committees.

In evaluating the student's performance and progress, all of the following is reviewed:

- Performance in the fulfillment of degree program requirements.
- Maintenance of a minimum GPA of 3.0 cumulatively and for every quarter of coursework.
    Cumulative and quarterly GPA's are computed on courses taken while the student is enrolled
    in the UW Graduate School. Computation is based only on courses numbered 400 - 599;
    courses graded I, S/NS, and CR/NC are excluded, as are the 600-800 series.
- Performance during informal coursework and seminars.
- Research capability, progress, and performance.

A determination of satisfactory performance and progress may be made upon review of the factors

indicated above and consideration of the student's progress relative to other students (part- time/full-
time) in the program or to an individually negotiated schedule. Full or partial withdrawal from a

quarter may be considered as failure to maintain satisfactory progress and a student may be dropped
as a result if he or she was on final probation for the previous quarter.

When review of a student's performance and progress result in a determination that it has been

unsatisfactory, the name of the student and recommendation for action--i.e., probation, final
probation, or drop--must be transmitted by the Graduate Program Coordinator or the head of the
graduate program to the Dean of the Graduate School by the appropriate deadline dates. A well-

documented statement of the circumstances involved must accompany all recommendations of
unsatisfactory performance and progress and the majority of the graduate faculty, delegated

representatives, or supervisory committee involved supports evidence that the action requested.
Students must receive written notification of this action, which includes information regarding the

necessary steps the student must take to maintain good standing in their graduate student status.

Deadlines:

Drop recommendations must be sent to the Graduate School by the fifth day of class; probation
and final probation recommendations must be sent to the Graduate School by the tenth day of class.

Students who are on official leave or are not registered cannot be recommended for probation, final
probation, or drop.

Recommended Guidelines:

Below are guidelines to determine recommended action for unsatisfactory performance and

progress. The Dean of the Graduate School will review recommendations for probation, final
probation, and drop. Probation and final probation recommendations are noted on a student's


unofficial transcript. In addition to notification from their graduate program, students will receive

final probation and drop status letters from the Dean of the Graduate School.

Recommendations must be reported to the Graduate School every quarter. No action will appear

on the transcript for any subsequent quarter unless a new recommendation is made to the Dean of
the Graduate School.

```
No Action: Recommended for those students whose cumulative GPA is above 3.0 but whose
most recent quarter's work is below 3.0, if the review has determined that this condition is not
cause for immediate concern.
```
```
Warn: This status is initiated and documented by the graduate program, but is not reported to
the Graduate School and does not appear on the student's transcript. The graduate program is
expected to notify each student in writing and place any documentation in the student's file. 1.)
Recommended for students whose cumulative GPA has dropped slightly below 3.0--i.e. 2.99-
2.95. 2.) Recommended for students who have failed to meet expectations for performance and
progress as determined by the graduate program.
```
```
Probation: A graduate program may recommend numerous quarters of probation for a student,
but the Graduate School recommends no more than three consecutive quarters (each quarter
must be recommended separately). All students must be informed of the graduate program's
policy regarding the length of probationary periods. Recommended for students who have not
corrected the deficiency which caused the warn action within the time limit specified by the
graduate program. Recommended for students who depart suddenly and substantially from
scholarly achievement as defined by the graduate program. (A previous warn recommendation is
not necessary.)
```
```
Final Probation: After at least one quarter of probation, a graduate program may recommend
final probation. Final probation may only be recommended for one quarter, though the
Graduate School will consider one additional quarter in extenuating circumstances. A graduate
program must recommend one quarter of final probation before recommending a student be
dropped from the program. The Graduate School will consider exceptions to this policy in
extenuating circumstances. Recommended for students who have not corrected the condition(s)
that caused the probation recommendation within the time limit specified by the graduate
program. Recommended for students who may have corrected previous probation conditions
but failed additional performance requirements and did not progress toward completion of the
graduate program.
```
```
Drop: A graduate program may recommend a student be dropped from their program after one
quarter of final probation. The Graduate School will consider exceptions to this policy only in
extenuating circumstances. If the Graduate School accepts a drop recommendation, the
Graduate School notifies the Registrar and the student is immediately removed from the
graduate program. This is the final action to be recommended for students who have not
corrected the condition(s) that caused the final probation recommendation within the time limit
specified by the graduate program.
```
```
Appeals: Students may appeal these recommendations directly to the Chair or Director of the
graduate program. Appeals beyond this point must follow the process outlined in Graduate
School Memorandum No. 33, Academic Grievance Procedure.
http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo33.shtml
```
## 2.4 GRADING SYSTEM FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS

In reporting grades for graduate students, graduate degree-offering units shall use the system


described herein. Grades shall be entered as numbers, the possible values being 4.0, 3.9, and

decreasing by one-tenth until 1.7 is reached. The Registrar will record grades below 1.7 as 0.0 and no
credit is earned. A minimum of 2.7 is required in each course that is counted toward a graduate

degree. A minimum cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 is required for graduation.

```
I Incomplete. An Incomplete may be given only when the student has been in attendance and
has done satisfactory work to within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished
proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or
other circumstances beyond the student's control. To obtain credit for the course, a student
must successfully complete the work and the instructor must submit a grade. In no case may an
Incomplete be converted into a passing grade after a lapse of two years or more. An incomplete
received by the graduate student does not automatically convert to a grade of 0.0 but the "I" will
remain as a permanent part of the student's record.
```
```
N No grade. Used only for hyphenated courses and courses numbered 600 (Independent
Study and Research), 601 (Internship), 700 (Thesis), 750 (Internship), and 800 (Dissertation). An
N grade indicates that satisfactory progress is being made, but evaluation depends on
completion of the research, thesis, internship, or dissertation, at which time the instructor or
Supervisory Committee Chairperson should change the N grade(s) to one reflecting the final
evaluation.
```
```
S/NS Satisfactory/Not-Satisfactory. A graduate student, with the approval of the Graduate
Program Coordinator or Supervisory Committee Chairperson, may elect to be graded S/NS in
any numerically graded course for which he or she is eligible. If a student does not so elect, then
he/she will be graded on a numerical basis. If approval is granted the student must elect the
S/NS option either when registering or no later than the end of the seventh week of the quarter.
The instructor shall submit a numeric grade to the Registrar, who shall convert grades of 2.7 and
above to S and grades lower than 2.7 to NS.
```
```
CR/NC Credit/No Credit. With the approval of the faculty in the academic unit, any course
may be designated for grading on the CR/NC basis by notice in the appropriate Time Schedule.
For such courses, the instructor will submit a grade of CR or NC to be recorded by the
Registrar's Office for each student in the course at the end of the quarter. All courses numbered
600, 601, 700, 750 and 800 may be graded with a decimal grade, a CR/NC or N at the
instructors' option.
```
```
W Withdrawal. Refer to the University of Washington time schedule or homepage at
http://www.washington.edu/students/reg/wdoffleave.html.
```
```
HW Hardship Withdrawal. Grade assigned when a graduate student is allowed a hardship
withdrawal from a course after the seventh week of the quarter.
```
Unofficial withdrawal from a course shall result in a grade of 0.

```
The grade W and HW count neither as completed credits nor in computation of grade-point
average.
```
Graduate students who withdraw from the University (dropping all courses for the quarter) during
the first week of two consecutive quarters (Summer Quarter excepted) will not be eligible to register

as a continuing graduate student for the third quarter. Such graduate students must reapply as
former graduate students returning to the University. For example, if a graduate student withdraws

during the first week of Spring Quarter and Autumn Quarter, he or she must reapply as a returning
former graduate student for Winter Quarter.

Of the minimum credits required for a graduate degree, a graduate student must show numerical

grades in at least 18 quarter credits of course work taken at the University of Washington. These

numerical grades may be earned in approved 400 - level courses and 500-level courses.


A graduate student's grade-point average will be calculated entirely on the basis of number grades in
400 - and 500-level courses. The grades of S, NS, CR, NC, and N will be excluded, as will all grades

in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750, and 800, and in 100- and 200- level courses.

The graduate student may petition the Dean of the Graduate School to modify the procedures

described above. The petition should be accompanied by comments and recommendations from the
Graduate Program Coordinator or Supervisory Committee Chairperson.

Graduate Courses:

Graduate courses are intended for, and ordinarily restricted to, either students enrolled in the

Graduate School or graduate non-matriculated students, and are given numbers from 500 through

800. Some courses at the 300 and 400 levels are open to graduates. Such courses, when acceptable to
the supervisory committee and the Graduate School, may be part of the graduate program. Courses at

the 300 level are not included in the calculation of grade-point average (GPA) and will not apply

toward the minimum Graduate School requirement of 18 graded credits for the master's or doctoral
degree. Approved 400 - level courses are accepted as part of the major as well as minor or supporting
fields. Undergraduate research (499) is not accepted as part of the graduate program. Graduate

School Memorandum No. 36 offers additional information on graduate courses.

[http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo36.shtml](http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo36.shtml)

With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum of 10 credits per quarter of any
combination of courses numbered 600, 700, or 800.

Repeating Courses:

Graduate students may repeat any course. Both the first and second grades will be included in the

cumulative GPA. Subsequent grades will not be included, but will appear on the permanent record.
The number of credits earned in the course will apply toward degree requirements only once.

## 2.5 TRANSFER CREDIT

Masters Students
A student working toward the master's degree may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for

permission to transfer to the University of Washington the equivalent of a maximum of 6 quarter
credits of graduate level course work taken at another recognized academic institution. These credits

may not have been used to satisfy requirements for another degree. The petition must include a
recommendation from the graduate program coordinator and an official transcript indicating

completion of the course work. Transfer credits are not entered on the UW transcript.

University of Washington students who are within 6 credits of completing their undergraduate degree
and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter

immediately preceding admission to Graduate School for up to 6 credits in 500-level courses in
addition to the last 6 credits they require of undergraduate work. The graduate program which has

admitted the student must approve registration for the courses. The student, after admission to the
Graduate School, must file a petition with the Dean of the Graduate School to transfer the 6 credits.

The student must also provide a letter or e-mail from the office of Graduations and Academic
Records stating that these credits have not been applied toward the undergraduate degree.

Approved transfer credits are applied toward total credit count only for the master's degree. (Transfer

credits are not applicable toward a doctoral degree.) The 18 quarter credits of numerically graded
course work, and 18 quarter credits of 500-level-and-above course work may not be reduced by


transfer credit.

Credit taken as an undergraduate non-matriculated student or post-baccalaureate student at the

University of Washington may not be transferred into a graduate program. Credit by either
independent study through correspondence or advanced credit examinations is not transferable.

PhD Students

Graduate level coursework taken at another academic institution is not applicable toward a doctoral
degree; exceptions may be made for transfer students accompanying new University of Washington

faculty hires. Upon admission to the University of Washington, a petition to waive Graduate School
requirements may be submitted on the student’s behalf and will be reviewed on an individual basis.

Note: General examinations, candidacy, 27 dissertation credits, and a final examination cannot be
waived regardless of any transfer credits that are approved.

## 2.6 ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT

The enrollment requirement for the master's degree is 45 credits, 3 0 of which must be taken at the

University of Washington.

For the doctoral degree, the enrollment requirement is 90 credits, 60 of which must be taken at the
University of Washington. With the approval of the degree-granting unit, an appropriate master's

degree from a regionally accredited institution may substitute for (30 credits) of enrollment.
Doctoral study requires an immersion in an academic field and its intellectual community. Degree-

granting units may require a period of full-time and/or on-site study.

Only courses numbered 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 can be applied to enrollment or course credit in
the major field for advanced degrees (please see the Graduate Courses policy regarding courses

numbered 499). Courses numbered 300 are not applicable to enrollment or course credit toward

advanced degrees except when applied by permission of the graduate program coordinator or
supervisory committee toward the graduate minor or supporting courses. Courses numbered below
300 are not applicable to enrollment or course credit for advanced degrees.

Full-Time Enrollment:

Full-time quarterly enrollment for graduate students is 10 credits during the academic year (autumn,

winter and spring quarters) and 2 credits during the summer quarter.

Final Quarter Registration:

A student must maintain registration as a full- or part-time graduate student at the University for the

quarter the master's degree, the candidate certificate, or doctoral degree is conferred. A student who
does not complete all degree requirements by the last day of the quarter must be registered for the

following quarter.

Continuous Enrollment:

During the academic year (autumn, winter, and spring quarters), students must maintain continuous

enrollment by being registered full or part-time, registered in absentia, or have petitioned for on-
leave status. Students are not required to go on leave or register during summer quarter (unless it is

required for your RA or fellowship status). Failure to maintain continuous enrollment will result in
being dropped from the University and reapplication will be required to resume studies. Students

holding a teaching or research assistantship must be registered for the minimum credits required
during their appointment period (a minimum of 10 credits during autumn, winter, and spring

quarters, and 2 credits during summer quarter). For this purpose, courses being audited do not


count toward the minimum enrollment requirement.

## 2.7 GRADUATE ON-­‐LEAVE STATUS

```
Graduate students are required to maintain graduate status during their program of study. Failure to
maintain this status requires readmission to the University of Washington. Students who need to
take a quarter or quarters off without going through the readmission process must apply for on-
leave status. For complete details regarding on-leave status policy, refer to Graduate School
Memorandum 9: Petition for On Leave Status.
http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo09.shtml
```
On-Leave Eligibility:

## 2.10 ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAM

The University of Washington features one of the largest, most established international and English

language programs in the United States. We offer a wide variety of programs for both undergraduate

and graduate students to help you improve your English language skills, prepare for further study in
the United States and learn about American culture, business and other subjects. [http://www.ielp.edu.edu](http://www.ielp.edu.edu)

## 2.11 STUDENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT

Grants & Funding Information Service:

The Graduate Funding Information Service (GFIS) works with current and admitted UW graduate
students. GFIS helps students identify and use different resources to locate funding opportunities

for graduate school-related expenses including tuition, research, and conference and research travel.
In conjunction with the University of Washington's Graduate School, GFIS hosts a series of

workshops throughout the year. Students can also seek answers to their questions during drop-in
advising hours, can schedule individual appointments, or can request information by email. In

addition, GFIS maintains a subject guide that lists different funding resources by category and a blog
that informs students about fellowships, grants employment opportunities, and upcoming GFIS
events. [http://commons.lib.washington.edu/services/gfis](http://commons.lib.washington.edu/services/gfis)

Graduate Student Appointments:

All graduate student appointments are governed by policy as determined by the Graduate School.

This policy (Executive Order 28) in its entirety may be viewed online:

[http://www.grad.washington.edu/fellow/execor28.htm](http://www.grad.washington.edu/fellow/execor28.htm)

Vacancies for graduate student appointments (teaching and research assistantships) that occur


during the academic year are advertised within each academic unit. Details about each appointment

are obtained from the faculty member involved.

All graduate student appointments are based on continued graduate standing, satisfactory progress

towards a degree, and satisfactory service in carrying out the duties of the appointment.

Research Assistantships (RA’s):

Research Assistantships (RA’s) are typically half-time appointments (20 hours a week) for the nine-
month academic year (16 September to 15 June). RA’s can be extended to include summer quarter,

and in special circumstances, full-time support (40 hours a week) may be granted. Any graduate
student appointment in excess of 20 hours a week requires the approval of the student's major

professor and the SAFS GPC.

Teaching Assistantships (TA’s):

Teaching assistantships (TA’s) are available as half-time appointments (20 hours a week) during the

nine-month academic year and in limited numbers during summer quarter. A member of the faculty
is responsible for their training and welfare supervises the TA.

Additional information regarding departmental responsibilities regarding instruction by TA’s
(Graduate School Memorandum No. 14) can be found at:

[http://www.grad.washington.edu/Acad/gsmemos/gsmemo14.htm](http://www.grad.washington.edu/Acad/gsmemos/gsmemo14.htm)

Academic Student Employees – UW/UAW Contract:

Students serving as research and teaching assistants (also known as Academic Student Employees)

are covered by the UW/UAW contract. It is the purpose of this contract to provide for the wages,
hours and terms and conditions of employment of the employees covered by the agreement, to

recognize the continuing joint responsibility of the parties, to provide efficient and uninterrupted
services and satisfactory employee conduct to the public, and to provide an orderly, prompt,

peaceful and equitable procedure for the resolution of differences between employees and the
employer. The contract can be viewed:

[http://www.washington.edu/admin/hr/laborrel/contracts/uaw/contract/a02.html](http://www.washington.edu/admin/hr/laborrel/contracts/uaw/contract/a02.html)

Language Proficiency Requirements for Teaching Assistantship Appointments:

Teaching assistantships (TA’s) may be awarded to international and immigrant status students whose

native language is other than English if certain criteria are met. Among these criteria are English
proficiency test requirements, which stipulate that international graduate students must achieve a

minimum score of 580 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and a minimum of
230 on the Test of Spoken English (TSE) or SPEAK test, or they must successfully complete

English 102B (an ESL course for International Teaching Assistants offered by ESL programs)
before they can be assigned teaching responsibilities. Additional information can be found at:

[http://grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo15.shtml](http://grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo15.shtml)

Non-Resident Tuition Waivers:

The UW charges graduate tuition at two rates, one for Washington State residents and a higher one

for non-residents. These two rates are set by the Washington State Legislature, which also allots to
the University a restricted number of out-of-state Graduate/Professional tuition waivers. These

waivers allow out-of-state students to be charged in-state tuition. Although the students receive in-
state tuition, they are not considered residents of Washington State. Students who are approved for

the waiver are not eligible for state-funded aid (scholarships, grants, etc.).


```
VERY IMPORTANT: Please note that these tuition waivers are primarily attached to a fellowship,
research assistantship or teaching assistantship award, which also requires full-time registration (
or more credits). If you plan to reduce the number of credits you will NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR
THE TUITION WAIVER and will pay tuition at the non-resident rate.
http://www.washington.edu/students/reg/residency/graduateProfessional.html
```
SAFS Fellowships:

```
The School has endowments that provide a limited number of fellowships for both entering and
continuing students. All students who apply to the School are automatically considered for entering
fellowships. Fellowships for continuing students are competitive and applications are reviewed
annually by the School’s Recruitment, Admissions and Scholarships Committee (RASC) during
Winter Quarter. Awards are generally in the form of fellowships (equivalent to a 50% Research
Assistantship in terms of stipend/salary, health insurance benefits, and tuition waiver [i.e., Operating
and Technology Fees are waived]). Students may also request a scholarship (i.e., no stipend/salary) to
be used for tuition assistance. Awards range from small grants to larger awards, and are based on
academic scholarship, satisfactory progress, career achievement, and available resources. Funding
applications for continuing students must be submitted to the SAFS Student Services Office at least
two weeks prior to the meeting of the RASC at which applications are to be reviewed. Generally,
applications are due March 1 and the RASC meets in mid-March, but this is subject to change. Only
students who are current on their milestones and otherwise making satisfactory academic progress
will be considered for these fellowships. The fellowship application can be found in the forms
section of the SAFS website.

SAFS Program Requirements:

The Graduate School will not authorize graduation unless the department has indicated that the

student has satisfied both the Graduate School and SAFS requirements.

All requirements (including but not limited to oral and written examinations) imposed by the SAFS
program or by the student's supervisory committee must be satisfied.

## 4.2 ESTABLISHING A MASTER’S SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE

As a general principle, a faculty supervisory committee guides each student working toward a


graduate degree at the University of Washington. This committee serves an important evaluative and

mentoring function for the student throughout his or her graduate career.

Research Adviser /Supervisory Committee Chair:

The student is assigned a research adviser as part of the admission process. It is the research adviser’s

responsibility to act as chair of the master’s supervisory committee and assist the student in selecting
classes, designing a research program, and making contacts with professionals within and outside the

University of Washington.

Formation of the Master’s Supervisory Committee:

As soon as appropriate (typically after a research topic has been established) the student, in

consultation with the Supervisory Committee Chair, establishes a supervisory committee consisting
of two to four members. The Chair and at least one-half of the total membership must be members

of the Graduate Faculty. _A minimum of two committee members must also be SASF Core faculty_**.** The
supervisory committee will provide expertise and depth in areas related to the student’s research.

The student should rely primarily on the Supervisory Committee Chair and secondarily on the other
committee members for professional guidance. (Refer to Graduate School Memorandum No. 13

for more information: [http://grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo13.shtml](http://grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/memo13.shtml)

An additional resource for identifying potential committee members can be found on the University

of Washington Graduate Faculty Locator site. This site allows you to search by faculty name,
appointing department and research interests: [http://grad.washington.edu/gradfac/](http://grad.washington.edu/gradfac/)

Approval of Master’s Supervisory Committee:

A Request to Establish M.S. Supervisory Committee form **(Appendix B)** must be submitted to the
GPA. This request should include a brief synopsis of the intended thesis topic and names of

proposed committee members. This information is reviewed by the GPC for suitability of faculty
balance in relation to the selected topic.

First Master’s Supervisory Committee Meeting:

The first committee meeting should confirm the student's program of study. The first meeting will
deal primarily with a definition of course requirements.

The student is responsible for arranging all necessary meetings and furnishing required forms:

**Plan of Study Form:** The Plan of Study Toward the M.S. Degree form **(Appendix C)** is an
agreement between the student and the Supervisory Committee about what coursework will be

required of the student in order to graduate. It includes the core required courses as well as any
other courses the committee feels are necessary to give the student the required background in

his/her area of interests. It is also where:

- any recommended optional courses are listed;
- the projected timeframe for the Thesis Proposal is indicated;
- and core requirement waivers are suggested. (Please contact the SAFS GPA for any
    requests to waive SAFS or UW Graduate School requirements; a petitioning process is
    usually required.)


The form should be completed by the student and Supervisory Committee Chair and approved by

all committee members at the time of the first meeting.

While the form is being completed, care should be taken to write courses that are recommended but
not required in the “Recommended” section. The SAFS Graduate Program Adviser will compare the

approved Plan of Study form against the student’s transcript(s) before approving the Final
Examination Request to ensure that all “Required Core” and “Additional Required” courses were

completed before the students are allowed to defend and graduate.

**Human and Animal Advisory Certification Form:** Graduate students and chairs of all newly

formed committees (M.S. and Ph.D.) are also required to sign a Human and Animal Advisory
Certification form **(Appendix D)** documenting that the student has been advised of human and

animal subjects guidelines.

All completed forms should be forwarded to the SAFS GPA, reviewed by the GPC, and placed in the

student’s permanent file.

Subsequent Committee Meetings:

The committee should meet regularly to review the student's progress and thesis proposal. The
student can request additional committee meetings whenever he or she feels the need for such

consultation.

## 4.3 MASTER’S THESIS PROPOSAL

The student must select a thesis research topic and develop it in consultation with his or her

research adviser. The research project should be designed for completion, together with other
program requirements, within a two- to three-year period. The master's thesis should provide

evidence of the student's ability to carry out independent investigation and to present the results in a
clear and systematic form.

Submission of Thesis Proposal:

A student is expected to submit a thesis proposal to their supervisory committee by the 5th quarter
of study and before beginning substantive thesis research. The proposal provides evidence to the

committee of the student’s readiness to carry out the research, and also clarifies the expectations of
both the student and committee as to the final content of the thesis.

The objective of a thesis proposal is to ensure a definite plan for the work to be done. Once
approved by the supervisory committee it becomes an informal contract between the student and

the committee. In addition, a proposal serves as:

- A basis for discussions between student and committee regarding experimental design, data
    analysis, and focus of the coursework; and
- A clear statement of the amount of effort anticipated to produce an acceptable thesis.

While the thesis proposal serves as an agreement between student and committee, both parties also

must recognize that flexibility is needed to include later changes as experiments may fail and new
opportunities may arise.

Thesis Proposal Format:


The thesis research proposal should follow the general features of a research proposal. A typical

format is as follows:

- **Introduction:** General background, importance of the subject area; literature review.
- **Objective(s):** A concise statement of the purpose or objective of the project; this should
    flow logically from the introduction and be short and specific.
- **Methods:** General plans, specific methods, sampling or experimental design, duration, and
    projected procedure for data analysis; these methods should be appropriate for directly
    addressing the purpose or objective.
- **Results:** Results of theoretical investigations, experiments, field sampling, computer
    simulations, data analyses, etc., should be clearly stated.
- **Interpretation:** How will the results be interpreted? There should be explicitly stated
    inferences that would be drawn from all outcomes; outcomes that cannot be interpreted
    imply imprecise objectives or inappropriate methods.
- **Significance:** Why is this investigation justified? What is the scientific or practical
    contribution? For a dissertation proposal especially, the case eventually must be made that
    the results will be a significant contribution to knowledge, regardless of the experimental or
    observational outcomes.
- **Timeline/Workplan:** The timeline helps to assess whether the proposed research is
    feasible as planned and establishes milestones. Periods when there are activities which could
    slow progress (e.g., taking written and oral examinations for Ph.D. students) should be
    highlighted when accounted for when selecting milestones. The timeline should also indicate
    when likely outputs (e.g., scientific paper and reports) will be produced.

The length of the written proposal should be the minimum needed to do the job. For a master’s

thesis proposal, 8 - 10 pages including references would be appropriate. The intent is to write the
proposal early in the degree program. If written too late, it will begin to resemble the thesis in size

and scope, and its primary purpose will be lost.

Writing and Preparation of Thesis:

Writing a thesis or dissertation can be challenging, and working with your advisor and committee to

select a good and workable topic, planning and conducting your research, and doing the writing will
be your top priorities. However, paying attention to some additional and probably unfamiliar topics

now or in the early stages of your planning is also important.

For example, your electronic thesis/dissertation (ETD) will be published by ProQuest/UMI and by

the UW Libraries, and as a student, researcher and future author you should develop an
understanding of copyright, publishing and open access. When you submit your ETD for review
and publication, you will be required to read and accept two separate publishing agreements and

then be prompted to decide whether to publish your work right away or to delay its release. Basic
information and links to additional resources on these topics are available at:

- Policy for Deposit and Dissemination of Master's Theses and Doctoral Dissertations
- Access Options for Electronic Theses and Dissertations
- Electronic Theses and Dissertations – Copyright, Open Access and Publishing FAQ
- ProQuest/UMI Agreement - Traditional Publishing Agreement


- University Agreement - UW Libraries Thesis and Dissertation Submission Agreement

Detailed instructions on preparation and submission of your electronic thesis can be found at:

[http://grad.washington.edu/students/etd/](http://grad.washington.edu/students/etd/) and at

[http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml](http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml)

Approval of Thesis Proposal by Supervisory Committee:

**Master’s Thesis Proposal Form:** The supervisory committee certifies that they have reviewed and

approved the student’s thesis proposal by signing the Master’s Thesis Proposal form **(Appendix E).**
A copy of the form and thesis proposal should be given to the SAFS GPA.

## 4.4 MASTER’S FINAL EXAMINATION & THESIS SUBMISSION

End-of-Program Meeting with GPA:

Two quarters before you plan to take your final examination, please schedule a 30 minute appointment with the SAFS
GPA. At this meeting, the GPA will review your transcript, check your Plan of Study and confirm that all of your

milestones have been completed. If you fail to attend this meeting, your Request for M.S. Final Examination may not
be granted, resulting in postponing your graduation quarter.

Request for M.S. Final Examination:

The student must submit a complete, near-to-final draft of the thesis, which has been reviewed and

approved by the committee chair, to all members of his or her committee at least four weeks prior

to the Final Examination. After reading the draft, the supervisory committee signs off on the
Request for Final Examination form ( **Appendix F** ). The student then submits the Request for
Final Examination form to the SAFS GPA. Completion of this form verifies that your committee

has _read an entire near-to-final draft of your thesis and concurs that you are ready to sit for your final examination._

The final draft of the thesis takes place after the final examination, incorporating changes suggested
by the committee.

Online Master's Degree Request:

In addition to the Request for Final Examination form completed by the supervisory committee, the
student must submit the online Graduate School Master’s Degree Request found on the student

view of MyGrad Program (http://www.grad.washington.edu/mygrad/student.htm) within the first
nine weeks of the quarter in which he or she expects to complete the degree requirements. This

should be done only **after** your committee has signed the SAFS M.S. Final Examination form.

The filing of the online application is the responsibility of the student. After submitting the request

to the Graduate School, the SAFS GPA will review the student’s record to verify that all
requirements have been met. Completion of the master’s degree includes presentation at a public

seminar on the subject of the research and the completion and submission of the thesis to the
Graduate School.

Students must be registered as a graduate student and complete a minimum of two credits during

the quarter in which degree requirements are met and the degree is conferred.

If requirements for the master's degree are not completed during the quarter of the initial
application, the online Master’s Degree Request will become void and the student must complete a


new request during the first nine weeks of the quarter in which the degree program is to be

completed.

Final Examination:

The student, in consultation with the chair of the student's supervisory committee, arranges the time

and place of the Final Examination. The student is responsible for ensuring that the complete, near-
to-final draft of the thesis is available to **all** committee members with adequate time for review

before the examination takes place (at least four weeks).

After finalizing the final exam date and time, the student notifies the SAFS Front Desk for

assistance with reserving a conference room. It is recommended that students schedule their final
exam at least four weeks in advance of the date, but no less than two and a half weeks before the

end of the quarter.

The student reports on his or her research at the public seminar that is followed by a private oral

examination by the supervisory committee (final exam). The seminar and oral examination are
generally scheduled consecutively on the same day.

A minimum of two committee members must be present for the Final Examination to take place,
although all members of the supervisory committee must certify the results. If the examination is

not satisfactory, the committee may recommend to the Dean of the Graduate School that the
student be allowed to take another examination after an interval of study.

At the conclusion of the Final Examination the committee certifies the exam results by signing the

Request for Master's Degree form. This form is also known as the “warrant” and will be supplied by

the SAFS GPA just prior to the Final Exam. The signed “warrant” is returned to the SAFS GPA no
later than the last day of the quarter (defined as the last day of exams) in which the student expects
to receive the degree.

Any corrections of the thesis are completed after the Final Examination and must be submitted by

the last day of the quarter. For additional information on submitting the thesis refer to:
[http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml](http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml)

If the final version of the thesis is submitted after the end of the quarter, then the degree will be

conferred the following quarter and the student must register for a minimum of two credits for that
quarter.

## 4.5 GRADUATE REGISTRATION WAIVER FEE

The $250 Graduate Registration Waiver Fee is an optional fee paid in lieu of registration. It is

available to qualifying students for a **2 - week period directly following the quarter** in which all
Graduate School and graduate program degree requirements are met. Qualifying students who pay
this fee will graduate in the quarter following the fee payment period. Note: This option may have

an effect on the grace period for student loans becoming due; students should check with their

lenders for registration requirements before utilizing this option in lieu of registration.

Eligibility:

- Master's students who did not submit a Master's degree request prior to the request deadline
    for the quarter in which all degree requirements were completed
- Students who completed all degree requirements but needed additional time to format the


thesis (project papers are not included).

NOTE: International students must consult with an adviser in the Office of International Students

and Scholars to determine their eligibility for this option.

Requirements:

- Students must have been registered for the previous quarter
- Students must have completed all Graduate School and graduate program degree
    requirements (except for thesis submission)
- The fee must be paid no later than 14 calendar days following the last day of the quarter in
    which all degree requirements were met
- Master's students must submit a new master's degree request within the first 5 days of
    instruction for the quarter in which they will graduate
    (http://www.grad.washington.edu/mygrad/student.htm)
- Theses/Dissertations must be complete and accepted by the Graduate School within the 2
    week fee period

NOTE: The degree will not be conferred until the end of the quarter in which the degree is
submitted**.**

## 4.6 SECOND MASTER'S DEGREE:

A second master's degree may be earned at the University of Washington by completing an
additional set of requirements. Please refer to Concurrent Degree Programs and to Graduate

School Memorandum 35 for more information.

## 5.0 SAFS DOCTORAL DEGREE REQUIREMENTS

## 5.1 DOCTORAL DEGREE REQUIREMENTS

The doctoral degree is by nature and tradition the highest certificate of membership in the academic

community. As such, it is meant to indicate the presence of superior qualities of mind and
intellectual interests and of high attainments in a chosen field. It is not conferred merely as a

certificate to a prescribed course of study and research, no matter how long or how faithfully
pursued. All requirements and regulations leading to the doctoral degree are devices whereby the

student may demonstrate present capacities and future promise for scholarly work.

Degree requirements are set in part by the Graduate School and in part by the SAFS program. The

Graduate School sets University-wide requirements for minimum scholarship as outlined below. The
SAFS program sets the core curriculum and requires successful completion of a qualifying

examination. The program also requires a dissertation and an integrated program of coursework and
research during which the student learns the fundamentals of their specific field.

The schedule of doctoral degree timeline and procedures outlined in **Appendix G** provides guidance


on the expected rate of progress.

Graduate School Minimum Requirements:

```
1) Completion of a program of study and research as planned by the graduate program
coordinator in the student's major department or college and the Supervisory Committee. At
least 18 credits of course work at the 500 level and above must be completed prior to
scheduling the General Examination.
```
```
2) Presentation of 90 credits, 60 of which must be taken at the University of Washington. With
the approval of the degree-granting unit, an appropriate master's degree from an accredited
institution may substitute for 30 credits of enrollment.
```
```
3) Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of course work taken at the
UW prior to scheduling the General Examination. The Graduate School accepts numerical
grades in approved 400 - level courses accepted as part of the major, and in all 500 - level
courses. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 is required for a graduate degree at the
University.
```
```
4) Creditable passage of the General Examination. Registration as a graduate student is
required the quarter the exam is taken and candidacy is conferred.
```
```
5) Preparation of and acceptance by the Dean of the Graduate School of a dissertation that is a
significant contribution to knowledge and clearly indicates training in research. Credit for the
dissertation ordinarily should be at least one-third of the total credit. The Candidate must
register for a minimum of 27 credits of dissertation over a period of at least three quarters.
At least one quarter must come after the student passes the General Examination. With the
exception of summer quarter, students are limited to a maximum of 10 credits per quarter of
dissertation (800).
```
```
6) Creditable passage of a Final Examination, which is usually devoted to the defense of the
dissertation and the field with which it is concerned. The General and Final Examinations
cannot be scheduled during the same quarter. Registration as a graduate student is required
the quarter the exam is taken and the degree is conferred.
7) Completion of all work for the doctoral degree within ten years. This includes quarters spent
On-Leave or out of status as well as applicable work from the master's degree from the UW
or a master's degree from another institution, if applied toward one year of resident study.
```
```
8) Registration maintained as a full- or part-time graduate student at the University for the
quarter in which the degree is conferred (see detailed information under Final Quarter
Registration).
```
```
9) A student must satisfy the requirements that are in force at the time the degree is to be
awarded.
```
## 5.2 THE DOCTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE

Formation of the Doctoral Supervisory Committee, Including the GSR:

A doctoral supervisory committee should be formed as soon as appropriate, typically after a research
topic is established in Year 1 of the PhD program. The committee should be appointed no later

than four months prior to a General Examination. Appointment of a supervisory committee
indicates that the Graduate Faculty in a student's field finds a student's background and achievement

a sufficient basis for admission into a program of doctoral study and research. (see Graduate School
Memorandum 13, Supervisory Committees for Graduate Students).

Composition of the Doctoral Supervisory Committee:


In order to allow time to identify a suitable Graduate School Representative (GSR), it is suggested

that the doctoral supervisory committee be established at least four months prior to the intended
date of the General Examination.

The doctoral supervisory committee consists of a minimum of four members, at least three of
whom (including the Chair and the GSR) must be members of the Graduate Faculty with an

endorsement to chair doctoral committees. **In addition the chair, one other member must be
SAFS faculty.** A majority of the members must be members of the Graduate Faculty. The GSR

must be a productive scholar in his or her own research area that may differ from that of the
student’s dissertation project. The remaining members must be identified by the student's appointing

department or program as productive scholars in the student's major field and/or subfields. The
Chair(s) of a committee must be able and willing to assume principal responsibility for advising the

student. In addition, the Chair(s) should have adequate time available for this work and should
expect to be accessible to the student. Emeritus/a and affiliate faculty may serve as a Chair if the

above conditions are met. Co-Chairs may be appointed when both serve with equal importance on a
student’s supervisory committee and equally share the responsibility for the student's progress.

Graduate Student Representative (GSR):

The GSR represents the broad concerns of the Graduate School with respect to high standards of
scholarly performance, ensuring that the student’s mastery of the subject matter is broad and

comprehensive. The GSR is a voting member of the committee and must attest to the validity of
examinations, must indicate approval of the process by which examinations are conducted, must

ensure that the student is treated in an unbiased manner, and must represent The Graduate School in
ensuring university-wide standards of scholarly performance. Thus, the GSR must sign the warrant

and submit a standardized report on the examination process to the Dean of the Graduate School. As
a full voting member of the dissertation supervisory committee, the GSR provides an important

service function to The Graduate School and the University.

As with all doctoral supervisory committee members, the GSR is proposed to the Graduate School
by the Graduate Program Coordinator in the student’s degree-offering unit and must be a member
of the Graduate Faculty with an endorsement to Chair. Faculty members with primary, joint, or

affiliate appointments in the student’s degree-offering unit or the committee chair’s department are

not eligible to serve as the GSR. **It is vital that a conflict of interest in the selection of the GSR
be avoided**. Budgetary relationships, personal relationships, or research and/or publication
relationships between the GSR and either the student or the committee chair are examples of

possible conflicts of interest. The GSR is responsible for ensuring that no such conflicts of interest,

or appearance of conflicts of interest, exist, and must attest to this upon request.

Functions of the Doctoral Supervisory Committee:

Doctoral supervisory committee member responsibilities include the approval of a course of study

which will fulfill the general course requirements of the student's major and supporting fields,
conducting the student's General Examination and, when appropriate, recommending advancement

to Candidacy. The doctoral supervisory committee approves the Candidate's dissertation proposal
and guides the student in carrying out appropriate research for the dissertation. The Graduate

School does not stipulate the content of the dissertation; guidance on the dissertation is the
responsibility of the supervisory committee. At least four members of the committee (including the

Chair(s), GSR, and one additional Graduate Faculty member) must be present at both the General
and Final Examinations.

Procedure for Establishing Doctoral Supervisory Committee:


```
A Request to Establish Doctoral Supervisory Committee form (Appendix H) must be submitted to
the SAFS GPA. This request should include a brief synopsis of the intended dissertation topic and
names of proposed committee members. This information is reviewed by the GPC for suitability of
faculty balance in relation to the selected topic. After approval the SAFS GPA enters information in
MyGrad Program, formally notifying the Graduate School Dean of the formation of the committee.
```
First Supervisory Committee Meeting:

```
The committee should meet with the student within two weeks after formation to decide on the
student's program of study. The student is responsible for arranging all necessary meetings and
furnishing required forms.
```
```
The first meeting will deal primarily with a definition of course requirements. The following
paperwork must be completed at the first meeting:
```
- **Plan of Study Toward the Doctoral Degree form:** This form **(Appendix I)** must be completed by

```
the student and committee chair and approved by all committee members at the time	
  of	
  the	
  first	
meeting.	
  This	
  is	
  an	
  agreement	
  made	
  between	
  the	
  student	
  and	
  the	
  supervisory	
  committee	
  about	
  what	
coursework	
  will	
  be	
  required	
  to	
  complete	
  the	
  doctoral	
  degree.	
  It	
  includes	
  the	
  core	
  required	
  courses	
as	
  well	
  as	
  any	
  other	
  courses	
  the	
  committee	
  feels	
  are	
  necessary	
  to	
  give	
  the	
  student	
  the	
  required	
background	
  in	
  his/her	
  area	
  of	
  interest.	
  This	
  form	
  is	
  also	
  used	
  to	
  request	
  waivers	
  of	
  core	
  courses.
```
- Use of Human and Animal Subjects for UW Graduate Student Theses and Dissertations form:
    This form (Appendix G) must be completed by the student and committee chair at the first
    committee meeting

```
Both forms are given to the SAFS GPA for review by the Graduate Program Coordinator and kept in
the student's permanent file.
```
Subsequent Supervisory Committee Meetings:

```
The committee should meet regularly to review the student's progress and dissertation proposal. The
student can request additional committee meetings whenever he or she feels the need for such
consultation.
```
**3.2 5.3 Written Qualifying Examination**

```
The Qualifying Examination is a written exam required by the School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences
(SAFS) and administered by the PhD Supervisory Committee over a one-week period. The
Qualifying Exam should be completed within 18 months of residency in the doctoral program (e.g., if
entering in September, the written is completed by the end of the second Winter Quarter).
```
```
The Qualifying Exam is intended to be general, in the sense that it should cover a range of material
that the Supervisory Committee deems necessary for the education and future success of the student
in his or her area of interest within the aquatic sciences. If the Committee does not adequately
represent an area of expertise judged to be crucial to the student’s education, the chair of the
Committee is free to solicit participation from other members of the UW Graduate Faculty.
```
```
Prior to the Qualifying Exam, the student obtains guidance from each Committee member on the
subject matter to be covered and the expected question and answer formats. (Note: Graduate School
Representative (GSR) participation in the Qualifying Exam is optional.) The Qualifying Exam can be
either open- or closed-book, depending on the Committee’s preference. Each Committee member
(the GSR is optional) should submit questions to the chairperson, who is responsible for the final
```

```
content of the exam. The total time allotted for exam completion should not exceed one calendar
week.
```
```
The Supervisory Committee evaluates the Qualifying Exam and discusses the student's performance
via email, telephone, in-person, or any combination therein. Within two weeks of completing the
exam, the Committee chairperson meets with the student to discuss the results. If the exam is
satisfactory in all of its parts, as determined by the Supervisory Committee, the student is allowed to
schedule the General Examination, usually in a subsequent quarter. An approved Dissertation
Proposal must be on file before the General Exam can be scheduled.
```
```
Within two weeks of exam completion, the chair attaches all of the Committee members’ evaluations
to the Report on the PhD Qualifying Examination form, completes and signs the form, and submits
the form and evaluations to the SAFS GPA for the student’s file.
```
```
Because of extensive consultation with Committee members and use of UW resources during an
exam quarter, registration in at least two credits (e.g., Fish 800) is required when taking the Qualifying
or Remedial Exam.
```
**3.3 Remedial Examination**

```
If the Qualifying Exam is unsatisfactory, the Supervisory Committee may require the student to take
a Remedial Exam within 30 days. This is a written exam designed to further explore and evaluate
competencies in the areas needing improvement. The Committee shall provide the student with a
detailed analysis of his or her performance on the Qualifying Exam, including, if necessary, a
discussion and decision regarding the continuance of the student in the doctoral program. The chair
is responsible for the final content and format of the Remedial Exam, in consultation with the rest of
the Committee. Prior to the Remedial Exam, the Committee may require a student to take additional
courses, complete a series of readings, or satisfy other appropriate requirements. At the conclusion of
the Remedial Exam, the Committee chair submits the Report on the PhD Remedial Examination to
the SAFS GPA for the student’s file.
```
The Graduate Program Coordinator shall be apprised of all Remedial Examinations.

```
Because of extensive consultation with Committee members and use of UW resources during an
exam quarter, registration in at least two credits (e.g., Fish 800) is required when taking the Qualifying
or Remedial Exam.
```
```
Pending satisfactory completion of the Qualifying or Remedial Exam, when applicable, the student is
allowed to schedule the General Examination, usually in a subsequent quarter. An approved
Dissertation Proposal must be on file before the General Exam can be scheduled.
```
## 5 .4 5.4 DOCTORAL DISSERTATION

```
The student must select a dissertation research topic and develop it in consultation with his or her
research adviser. The research project should be designed for completion, together with other
program requirements, within a three to five-year period. The doctoral dissertation should provide
evidence of the student's ability to carry out independent investigations and to present the results in
a clear and systematic form.
```
Submission of Dissertation Proposal:

```
A student is expected to submit a dissertation proposal to their supervisory committee before the
end of the 5th quarter of study in the Ph.D. program (Winter Quarter – Year 2 of Ph.D. program)
```

and before beginning substantive dissertation research. The proposal provides evidence to the

committee of the student’s readiness to carry out the research, and also clarifies the expectations of
both the student and committee as to the final content of the thesis.

The objective of a dissertation proposal is to ensure a definite plan for the work to be done. Once
approved by the supervisory committee it becomes an informal contract between the student and

the committee. In addition, a proposal serves as:

- A basis for discussions between student and committee regarding experimental design, data

analysis, and focus of the coursework; and

- A clear statement of the amount of effort anticipated to produce an acceptable thesis.

While the dissertation proposal serves as an agreement between student and committee, both parties

also must recognize that flexibility is needed to include later changes as experiments may fail and new
opportunities may arise.

Dissertation Proposal Format:

The dissertation research proposal should follow the general features of a research proposal. A typical
format is as follows:

- **Introduction:** General background, importance of the subject area; for a dissertation proposal
    especially, there should be a substantial literature review.
- **Objective(s):** A concise statement of the purpose(s) or objective(s) of the project; this should

flow logically from the introduction and be short and specific.

- **Methods:** General plans, specific methods, sampling or experimental design, duration, and
    projected procedure for data analysis; these methods should be appropriate for directly
    addressing the purpose(s) or objective(s).
- **Results:** Results of theoretical investigations, experiments, field sampling, computer simulations,
    data analyses, etc., should be clearly stated.
- **Interpretation:** How will the results be interpreted? There should be explicitly stated inferences

```
that would be drawn from all outcomes; outcomes that cannot be interpreted imply imprecise
objectives or inappropriate methods.
```
- **Significance:** Why is this investigation justified? What is the scientific or practical contribution?

```
For a dissertation proposal especially, the case eventually must be made that the results will be a
significant contribution to knowledge, regardless of the experimental or observational outcomes.
```
- **Timeline/Workplan:** The timeline helps to assess whether the proposed research is feasible as

```
planned and establishes milestones. Periods when there are activities which could slow progress
(e.g., taking written and oral examinations for Ph.D. students) should be highlighted when
accounted for when selecting milestones. The timeline should also indicate when likely outputs
(e.g., scientific paper and reports) will be produced.
```
The length of the written proposal should be the minimum needed to do the job. For a doctoral
dissertation proposal, 10 - 15 pages are probably realistic. The intent is to write the proposal early in
the degree program. If written too late, it will begin to resemble the dissertation in size and scope,

and its primary purpose will be lost.


Approval of Dissertation Proposal:

The supervisory committee certifies that they have reviewed and approved the student’s dissertation
proposal by signing the Doctoral Dissertation Proposal form **(Appendix J).** A copy of the form

and dissertation proposal should be given to the SAFS GPA.

Writing and Preparation of Dissertation:

The electronic thesis/dissertation (ETD) will be published by ProQuest/UMI and by the UW

Libraries, and as a student, researcher and future author you should develop an understanding of
copyright, publishing and open access. When you submit your ETD for review and publication, you
will be required to read and accept two separate publishing agreements and then be prompted to

decide whether to publish your work right away or to delay its release. Basic information and links to
additional resources on these topics are available at:

- Policy for Deposit and Dissemination of Master's Theses and Doctoral Dissertations
- Access Options for Electronic Theses and Dissertations
- Electronic Theses and Dissertations – Copyright, Open Access and Publishing FAQ
- ProQuest/UMI Agreement - Traditional Publishing Agreement
- University Agreement - UW Libraries Thesis and Dissertation Submission Agreement

Detailed instructions on preparation and submission of your electronic dissertation can be found

at: [http://grad.washington.edu/students/etd/](http://grad.washington.edu/students/etd/) and at
[http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml](http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml)

## 5.5 REQUEST FOR GENERAL EXAMINATION – ADMISSION TO CANDIDACY

A General Examination may be scheduled if:

- the student has completed 60 credits (some of these credits may be taken the same quarter of

the exam);

- all required program examinations that do not need Graduate School approval have been
    completed (for SAFS PhD students, this is a written qualifying exam) and;
- all members of the supervisory committee agree that the student's background of study and

preparation is sufficient and have approved the student to schedule a General Examination.

At least four members of a supervisory committee (including the Chair, Graduate School

Representative, and one additional Graduate Faculty member) must be present at the examination.

If the General Examination is satisfactory, the supervisory committee members who participate at

the examination sign the “warrant” (this form will be provided by the SAFS GPA prior to the
exam) and return it to the SAFS GPA by the last day of the quarter (last day of finals week). If an

examination is unsatisfactory, a supervisory committee may recommend that the Dean of the
Graduate School permit up to a maximum of two additional reexaminations after a period of

additional study. Any members of a supervisory committee who do not agree with the majority
opinion are encouraged to submit a minority report to the Dean of the Graduate School.

Registration as a graduate student is required the quarter that a General Examination is taken. When
the Graduate School approves candidacy, a student is identified and designated as a candidate for

the appropriate doctoral degree and is awarded a candidate certificate. After achieving candidate
status, a student ordinarily devotes his or her time primarily to the completion of research, writing of


the dissertation, and preparation for the Final Examination.

A candidate certificate and the doctoral degree may not be awarded the same quarter.

Procedure for Requesting the General Examination:

The SAFS Request for Doctoral General Examination form **(Appendix K)** must be signed by all

members of the Supervisory Committee. However, the exam may take place with the minimum
number of members specified in Graduate School Memorandum No. 13 (i.e., at least four members

including the Chair, GSR, and another Graduate Faculty member). Email approvals or faxed
signatures are acceptable if attached to the form. The date, time, and location of the exam must be

indicated in all approvals.

In addition, the student **MUST** also schedule the Doctoral General Exam **online** with the Graduate

School at [http://www.grad.washington.edu/mygrad/student/htm](http://www.grad.washington.edu/mygrad/student/htm)

## 5.6 CANDIDATE CERTIFICATE:

A candidate certificate gives formal recognition to a successful completion of a very significant step

towards a doctoral degree. Students who have passed a General Examination and have completed all
requirements for a doctoral degree, except a Final Examination and Graduate School acceptance of
a dissertation, are awarded a candidate certificate. Candidacy is conferred on the last day of a quarter

and certificates are issued by the Graduation and Academic Records office approximately 4 months
after this date.

## 5.7 DOCTORAL READING COMMITTEE

Appointment and Responsibilities of a Doctoral Reading Committee:

After the General Examination, the SAFS GPA uses MyGrad Program to inform the Dean of The

Graduate School of at least three members of the supervisory committee who will serve on the
reading committee. At least one of the members of the reading committee must hold an

endorsement to chair doctoral committees. The reading committee is appointed to read and approve
the dissertation. It is the responsibility of a reading committee to:

- ensure that the dissertation is a significant contribution to knowledge and is an acceptable
    piece of scholarly writing;
- determine the appropriateness of a candidate's dissertation as a basis for issuing a warrant for
    a Final Examination and;
- approve a candidate's dissertation.

Procedure for Establishing Doctoral Reading Committee:

When a near-to-final draft of the dissertation has been completed, the student must establish his/her
reading committee by completing the SAFS Doctoral Reading Committee Request form **(Appendix**

**L).** This form is returned to the SAFS GPA who uses MyGrad Program to inform the Dean of The
Graduate School.

The Final Examination may not be established until after the reading committee has read an entire
draft of the dissertation and the supervisory committee has agreed that the student is prepared and

has approved the student to schedule a Final Examination.


## 5.8 FINAL EXAMINATION – DISSERTATION DEFENSE

End-of-Program Meeting with GPA:

Two quarters before you plan to take your final examination, please schedule a 30 minute appointment with the

SAFS GPA. At this meeting, the GPA will review your transcript, check your Plan of Study and confirm that all of
your milestones have been completed. If you fail to attend this meeting, your Request for PhD Final Examination
may not be granted, resulting in postponing your graduation quarter.

**A Final Examination may be scheduled if:**

- a student passed a General Examination in a previous quarter;
- a reading committee is officially established with the Graduate School;
- the reading committee has read an entire draft of the dissertation and;
- the entire supervisory committee has agreed that the student is prepared and has approved the

student to schedule a Final Examination.

At least four members of a supervisory committee (including the Chair, Graduate School

Representative, and one additional Graduate Faculty member) must be present at the examination.

If the Final Examination is satisfactory, the supervisory committee members who participate at the

examination sign the warrant and return it to the SAFS GPA by the last day of the quarter (last day of
finals week). Any members of a supervisory committee who participate at an examination but do not

agree with the majority opinion are encouraged to submit a minority report to the Dean of the
Graduate School. If an examination is unsatisfactory, a supervisory committee may recommend that

the Dean of the Graduate School permit a second examination after a period of additional study.

After the Final Examination, the candidate has 60 days in which to submit a dissertation to the
Graduate School. Registration as a graduate student is required the quarter that a Final Examination

is taken AND the quarter the dissertation is submitted. If the 60-day time period expires, another

Final Examination may be required. The degree is conferred the quarter in which the Graduate
School accepts the student’s dissertation.

A candidate certificate and the doctoral degree may not be awarded the same quarter.

Procedure for Requesting the Final Examination:

After the Chair approves the student to sit for the Final Examination, the SAFS Request for
Doctoral Final Examination form **(Appendix M)** must be completed by **ALL** members of the

Supervisory Committee and given to the SAFS GPA. Email approvals or faxed signatures are

acceptable if attached to the form. The date, time, and location of the exam must be indicated in all
approvals.

The exam may take place with the minimum number of members specified in Graduate School

Memorandum No. 13 (i.e., at least 4 members including the Chair, GSR, and another Graduate

Faculty member).

In addition, the student **MUST** also schedule the Doctoral Final Examination online with the
Graduate School at [http://www.grad.washington.edu/mygrad/student/htm](http://www.grad.washington.edu/mygrad/student/htm)


Prior to the Final Examination the SAFS GPA will print out the “Warrant” form provided by the
Graduate School. All members of the committee present at the Final Examination must sign this

form. The completed form is returned to the SAFS GPA who then notifies the Graduate School of

the results of the Final Examination.

## 5.9 FINAL SUBMISSION OF DOCTORAL DISSERTATION

Any corrections of the dissertation are completed after the Final Examination and must be

submitted by the last day of the quarter. For additional information on submitting the dissertation
refer to: [http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml](http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/info.shtml)

The $250 Graduate Registration Waiver Fee is an option if all degree requirements have been met by
the final day of the quarter with the exception of the dissertation.

## 5.10 GRADUATE REGISTRATION WAIVER FEE

The $250 Graduate Registration Waiver Fee is an optional fee paid in lieu of registration. It is
available to qualifying students for a **2 - week period directly following the quarter** in which all

Graduate School and graduate program degree requirements are met. Qualifying students who pay
this fee will graduate in the quarter following the fee payment period. Note: This option may have

an effect on the grace period for student loans becoming due; students should check with their
lenders for registration requirements before utilizing this option in lieu of registration.

Eligibility:

- Students who completed all degree requirements but needed additional time to format the
    dissertation (project papers are not included).

NOTE: International students must consult with an adviser in the Office of International Students
and Scholars to determine their eligibility for this option.

Requirements:

- Students must have been registered for the previous quarter.
- Students must have completed all Graduate School and graduate program degree
    requirements (except for dissertation submission).
- The fee must be paid no later than 14 calendar days following the last day of the quarter in
    which all degree requirements were met.
- Dissertations must be complete and accepted by the Graduate School within the 2 week fee
    period.

NOTE: The degree will not be conferred until the end of the quarter in which the degree is

submitted**.**

## 6.0 MASTER’S DEGREE BY-PASS

Students Admitted at pre-Master’s Level:

```
Students admitted at the pre-master’s level may apply to proceed directly to the PhD program after
completing all Master’s by-pass requirements.
```
```
Students pursuing the master’s by-pass option should be aware that the by-pass requirements are
very similar to those of the master’s degree with thesis. Pursuing the master’s by-pass option does
not necessarily speed up the time-to-degree and may be appropriate only under exceptional
circumstances. Students must carefully weigh the benefits and risks of pursing the master’s by-pass
option.
```
## 6.1 MASTER’S BY-­‐PASS PROCEDURE

Application should be made to the Recruitment, Admissions, and Scholarships Committee (RASC) via
the Student Services Office. Interested students should consult with the Graduate Advisor to

determine the relevant deadline, which is dependent upon when RASC is meeting next. Applications
will be considered only if all M.S. coursework has been completed and must include the following

documentation:

- A statement from the student that describes their current M.S. research and illustrates the
    scientific direction and rationale they will take in expanding it to merit Doctoral status. The
    statement should also include a plan for coursework that supports their Doctoral degree,
    while also satisfying program requirements, as well as a funding plan.
- A statement from the Master’s committee chairperson confirming:
    - that the student’s research has progressed to the point of demonstrating competence at
       the Master’s level
    - the completed M.S. research is a considerable and meaningful base of work for the
       proposed Ph.D. research, and, the proposed Ph.D. research is a substantive and
       logical advance from the M.S. research; evidence for this should be outlined in the
       draft Doctoral dissertation proposal
    - guaranteeing space and financial support for the student for at least the first academic
       year of Doctoral study; and
    - their approval of the draft Doctoral proposal.
- Current CV or resume;
- UW transcript (unofficial);
- A letter or email (to safs@uw.edu) from each member of the student's MS Supervisory
    Committee indicating that they have read the draft Doctoral proposal, confirm that it
    constitutes a sufficient basis for a PhD dissertation, as well as their approval to bypass the
    MS Degree;
- A copy of the M.S. thesis proposal;
- A draft doctoral dissertation research proposal that outlines each chapter of the Ph.D.
    dissertation, including methods, likely outcomes and significance. Importantly, this must
    demonstrate that the proposed body of proposed work would satisfy the requirements for a
    Ph.D. degree This will not be the final dissertation proposal that will later be defended for
    the General Examination – you will still be expected to submit a formal dissertation


proposal after your bypass application has been accepted;

- Copy of a paper accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal; a manuscript

```
that has been submitted (or deemed submittable) to a journal may also be acceptable, in
which case letters from at least two MS committee members indicating that the manuscript
is scientifically rigorous and publishable are required
