Town Hall Meeting  11/7/2019
---
Purpose: Build community among graduate students and fostering relationships with graduate students and GPC and GPA.

In addition to in-person interactions, an anonymous survey was sent out to all students. These are the [same survey questions](https://d.pr/i/a9zMH4) that have been sent out prior to every town hall meeting.  

It was mentioned that it would be great to have common equipment resources in SAFS listed in a central place. Discussion occurred how this might be different than email requests. It was indicated this would complement email as numerous resources might solve issues, and there was the potential for new equipment discovery.
A [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-n5wvKKEyk3S3qd4sjrjTC9O1nU_T8mQhu7aL5L6uQs/edit?usp=sharing) has been set up for labs to compile. Students will need to use UW emails to edit.

Increased communication among students and committees was identified as a means for students to be better informed about the bypass formatting and qualifying exam expectations and experience. This is planned to be addressed in 1) the new review forms, 2) the faculty handbook, and 3) an updated student handbook. As all of these documents are not yet live, Steven will send an email to graduate students indicating how they should communicate with the committee in this regard.

Students were thrilled with the fact that announcements would be made before seminar Thursdays. This would be a great way to increase seminar participation and inclusion. It was recommended that labs hosting TGIT that day should be acknowledged. Steven will follow up with Ann regarding Dan doing this, or determine an alternative.

The existence of a [SAFS calendar](https://fish.uw.edu/news-events/events/#/?i=2) was noted and ways to better use this resource to improve inclusiveness were discussed. To suggest additions to this calendar, email safsdesk@uw.edu.

The topic of students paying for snacks for committee meetings (etc) was brought up. Steven indicated that this was a topic the UW Graduate School council was discussing this month and the UC system has eliminated this. Steven suggested students discuss this with their advisor and if snacks were preferred the students get reimbursed from the advisor’s RCR account.

An anonymous drop box will be placed by the coffee machine outside of Amy’s office so students can submit feedback, concerns, or comments about what is going well anonymously. Also, Amy will resend the Town Hall anonymous Google form survey and encourage students to submit feedback on the Town Hall structure/format and to utilize the same form throughout the rest of the quarter.
