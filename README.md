Misc.

Just a reminder that Academic faculty are allowed to do up to 2 months per academic year in Salary Exchange..one 1month in each of 2 quarters, per the College policy.

That means that you can pay yourself 1 month from grants, and we will return that salary to you by placing it in your individual RCR (we will not transfer the benefits).
