Present: Fox, Roberts, Punt, Simenstad, Olden, Scheuerell,  Seeb, Friedman

Bypass (1) :
Agreement on proceeding. Amy will follow up with NOAA to get confirmation on funding commitment.

GRE Requirement:
Discussion of requirement including pros and cons. One model going forward could be not making it a SAFS requirement but possibly some faculty might require for acceptance. With this scenario, GREs would not be considered by RASC in identifying scholarship eligible students.
It was mentioned that GRE scores are responsible for biggest discrepancy in scoring across RASC members.
Steven will bring topic up at Nov 5 faculty meeting.

Emergency / Final Quarter Funding Process:
Determined we shift to reviewing requests on a quarterly basis, for requests that would be two quarters out. For example a request that came in at the beginning of Fall quarter would be for Spring quarter.  Deadlines would be 10/10, 1/10, 4/10, and 7/10.
We were reminded that this is the same pool of funds used for recruiting scholarships and should be considered.
Steven will announce this change at Nov 5 faculty meeting. Amy will revise web documentation.

2020 Admissions process:
Process will be as in the past where all applicants get two reviews and we then identify ones that get reviewed by all of RASC to determine those scholarship eligible. We will ask faculty if they want anyone reviewed by all prior to providing them with our scoring. It is expected that applications will be assigned by December 20.
Steven will identify a time to meet the week of December 10 to go over process and compare scoring.
